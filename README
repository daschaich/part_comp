This is code for non-perturbative renormalization (NPR) of three-fermion
operators in the regularization-independent momentum scheme (RI/MOM), using
lattice gauge theory with domain wall fermions (DWF).

Dependences:
The USQCD SciDAC libraries QMP, QIO, QLA, QDP and QOPQDP
The qcdlib library (http://lattice.bu.edu/qcdalg/qcdlib)
LAPACK and BLAS are required by qcdlib
FFTW, the "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West", at least v3.3.2

Structure:
The task is currently split up into two parts:
1) invertAPBC is parallel code to carry out DWF inversions with anti-periodic
   boundary conditions, saving to disk the resulting propagator and some
   results from standard DWF measurements including the residual mass and axial
   renormalization constant.
2) process_prop is serial code that loads a saved propagator and carries out
   the necessary contractions to carry out RI/MOM NPR for three-fermion
   operators.  It is serial since it performs multi-dimensional Fourier
   transforms from real space to momentum space and I've never been able to get
   FFTW to run in parallel.
